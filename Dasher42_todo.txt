TO DO:  Favor The Bold

* Framework for attaching special technologies to ships - no hard-coded species numbers!
  X Finish and test TriggerDefs
  X Make special torpedo and pulse yields
  X Make special shield and hull
  X Ablative armor and other similar technologies
  - Adapt Apollo's ATP GUI controls, as they refine Sleight's work
  X MIRVing torpedoes
  X Time-cycling plugins for things like torpedoes that lose power
  - Tractor effects
  - Make tractors have more capability?  Block them with shields?
  - Shield modulations

- Merge Defiant, SimRex, and Leo's work on Sleight's FTB scripts.  
- Absorb the Engineering extension
- Fix the Ablative Armour; Leo's work enables the bar graph but the tech seems to have broken
- Create the Foundation GUI
- Fix the race/ship name display in multiplayer
* Enable FTB and mutators in single player

* Set up Sneaker's inaccurate phasers to work with the AI
  * Tune the phaser accuracy

- Merge with Apollo's Dimensions with a common ship instance and mission objective API.
- Make the target at will button use Sleight's secondary targetting
X Make autolayout of damage and weapon icons
- Consider new ways to do selection of crew members and uniform
- Dialogue options - multiple choice questions and responses
- Friendly/hostile/obsequious communication postures
- Intelligent alien personalities.  They can vary between friendly, neutral, or hostile
  considering things like overall relations, the status of your ship's weapons and shields, and
  dialogue choices.
- Crew options on tactical and other views:  away team deployment (science/engineering/security)
* Random system generator
- Plug-in mission elements
- Weapons must start at 0 charge when going into red alert.  When disarmed, some of their energy
  should go back into the main battery.


TO DO:  Foundation

X Make Mutators list scrollable
X Fix bridge plugins
X Plugin architecture for music replacements
X Explosion effect plugin (Nano's got this)



CANCELLED:

- CANCELLED:  Astrogation screen, preferably 3D
  This is now Apollo's field.
* Seamless 3D universe, allowing real-time warp speed and intercepts
  This has proven unworkable due to camera stutter which is pronounced at warp speeds.
  Seamless solar systems would be very workable, however, and QBR and Apollo's Dimensions
  pave the way for going between systems.  I like Nano's warp, however.  Having some time
  before arrival to adjust ship systems is a big boost.
